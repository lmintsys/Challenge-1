# horiseon-code-refactor
## Description

The aim of this project was to refactor the starter code of the Horiseon website to increase its accessibility. 
Enhanced accessibility of the Horiseon website will benefit those users who rely on assistive technologies to access the website. It will also enhance the website's SEO positioning within different search engines.
Working on this project, provided me with a valuable practical knowledge of what factors contribute to a good accessibility, such as inclusion of semantic elements, consolidation of repetitive elements in CSS, and overall clarity of the code.

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

The refactored code will be used by assistive tehchnologies to aid users that rely on them accessing the content of the website as well as by search engines for an enhanced SEO. 
The code can be viewed following this link: https://github.com/lmintsys/horiseon-code-refactor
The standard usage of the website remained the same after refactoring.
